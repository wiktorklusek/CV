    <h1>Hello, I'm Wiktor and I'm a software developer with a passion for creating exceptional digital experiences.</h1>
    <p>With over 2 years of experience in web development, I specialize in creating user-friendly and accessible web applications using the Vue.js and Node.js frameworks. I'm always on the lookout for new and innovative technologies to improve my skills, and I'm passionate about creating web applications that make a difference in people's lives.</p>
    <h2>One of my recent projects:</h2>
        <p>I recently built a visualization website that allows users to explore and analyze large datasets in an interactive and user-friendly way. The website was built using Vue.js and Node.js. You can check it out <a href="https://myprojectdemo.com">here</a> and see how I helped make data more accessible and understandable to the public.</p>
    <h2>When I'm not coding, I enjoy:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Exploring the great outdoors through hiking and camping</li>
      <li>Capturing the beauty of nature through photography</li>
    </ul>
